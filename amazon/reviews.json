The M1 chip is a game-changer and offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, making it a joy to use. The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals that are easy on the eyes. The laptop comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage, which offers ample space to store files and run multiple applications without any lag. The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality for virtual meetings.One of the standout features of this laptop is the Touch ID feature. It is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords. This feature, combined with the overall speed and efficiency of the M1 chip, makes for a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices.However, there are a few drawbacks to this laptop that led me to give it a 4-star rating. Firstly, the laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks, such as video editing or running multiple applications simultaneously. This can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes even affect performance. Secondly, the battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage. This is a bit of a letdown, as one of the key benefits of the M1 chip was supposed to be its efficiency and battery life.Finally, the lack of ports is a bit of a drawback. The laptop only comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means that users will need to purchase additional dongles or hubs to connect other devices. This can be inconvenient and adds to the overall cost of the laptop. Additionally, the absence of an SD card slot is a bit of a bummer, as it is a commonly used port by photographers and videographers.In conclusion, the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a great investment and offers a lot of features and benefits, but it does have some drawbacks. It is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications. Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-performance laptop that offers speed, efficiency, and convenience.Bullet points:The M1 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiencyThe 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visualsThe Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video qualityThe Touch ID feature is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwordsThe laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devicesThe laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasksThe battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usageThe lack of ports, particularly the absence of an SD card slot, is a bit of a drawback"},

Received securely packed, and brand new no issues there. Here are some pros and cons you may want to consider:1. Wonderful battery life: Most amazing feature of this laptop - can take it outdoors, with full screen brightness, and heavy workload (heavy programs running with 7GB / 8GB RAM used), it gives 8-10 hours or even more (haven't tried sitting all day outdoors).2. Great screen: Better than my Mi notebook pro, that too has good screen, but this one is brighter and crispier and the difference is well noted in bright sunlight.3. RAM management: I run chrome with 8-10 tabs open, heavy programs running that takes 14GB / 16GB RAM in my Mi notebok pro, this one manages it with 7GB / 8GB RAM. That's all. I felt some lag opening photoshop, 2-3 seconds delay clicking open button and actually opening of photoshop application, but I don't mind it. Comparing processing with my Mi notebook pro i5 with 16 GB RAM, this one is comparable.4. Light weight and slim: At cost of slightly smaller screen.Conclusion: This tool will get you through your general and programming needs with mac os."},

{"name": "Dhineshkumar", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Awesome Product", "review": "i was using macbook air early 2015 before. It was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. But i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to M1 Mac in exchange offer. I got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.After i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. Excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. Excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. Excellent display qualityI did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. Only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. You need a cleaning cloth always with you which I am carrying with me all the time with IPA liquid for better cleaning performance. But i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. Also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is onI thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually I purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. Luckily it was damaged on transit. After that again I did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. Hence, I claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased IP liquid to clean the screen.If you're a frequent traveler along with MacBook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it's not cleaned periodically. So, I purchased IP liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. It costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power IP liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from DMART). I believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. This liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the Screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees"},

{"name": "Anubhav Nautiyal", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Bittersweet experience", "review": "This is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do."},

{"name": "Amazon Customer", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Pocket rocket this Laptop is", "review": "I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?"},

But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months."},

After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.Why i opted for 8gb ram?My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too.I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture.So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging üòä).I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.***update after 10 months *****No regrets! This is super fast engine. I do a lot of coding now with this. I feel every software works like a charm in M1 now. Of course we have the updated processor now.

If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device.Pros:* Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left milesbeyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.* The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low powerconsumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop. The entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting.* Battery lasts very loooong, even for HQ 16 K video playback.* Display is very realistic with true colours.* Sound quality is great. Channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with soundscoming from all directions, far and near.Cons:* Very poor or no scope for expanding the RAM and storage size.* Software is expensive.* Additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive.* Such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty.* Other than 2 C type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. One C port is engaged forpower supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed \"C\" type USB port.* Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned. Compatibility, storage space, expandability areseverely constrained.Finally, like the PC's which can take MS Windows OS and also other OS platforms, Apple range of MacBooks should also be compatible universally for all platforms, with hardware expandability options like PCs.with any Operating systems."},

If you are using it for just media consumption and some general programming then you will not feel it getting hot ever.Considering the price difference between M1 and M2 models, this is a better choice if you do not want to spend nearly 50% more on M2 Air."},

Has great display, one of the best speaker, super portability and bunch of useful, yet free Apple softwares. For personal use this is just appropriate. Though it has 8 GBs of RAM; I tried GarageBand with my MiDi keyboard, multiple HD video editing in iMovie and it worked almost perfectly. And the best part is wake up feature. No matter how many days after I open the lid, the screen wakes up for action just instantly. Truely this feature is amazing.P.S. Amazon did not accept my old laptop for exchange, despite it being in working condition; saying the battery backup needs to be at least 1 hour. My old laptop was an HCL one, that they agreed on. And HCL stopped production 4 years ago. How can you ask for 1 hour of backup from such a laptop ... ü§£"},

It works extremely fast and is very smooth, the keys are great to type on. Though it has a good software and mostly good hardware, the camera quality is horrible. Its very blocky and the pixels are extremely visible. For the price, you can maybe get a better windows laptop but I have been a hardcore apple fan.Overall, I give it a 4.5 out of 5, it runs extremely smoothly even with multiple windows,tabs,apps etc open. My favourite part is the constant updates that apple provides that always upgrade the features and exemplify the user experience! I hope this helps =D."},

If one is used for charging and the other is used to connect the mouse then virtually you are left with no other port for a pen drive or printer. There is space where they could have given more ports.What I liked the most was the reduced bezels and scissors on the keyboard due to which the size of the laptop got reduced without compromising the 13.3-inch screen size. The screen is good, speed is fast, and beauty has increased, however, some may miss the glowing apple logo which has been replaced with a metal Apple logo.

They said if there is any issue with Apple products bought from Amazon, you need to first present it to the Apple store within the replacement period, i.e. 7 days. Apple store should give a certificate telling that there is an issue with the product. Amazon will consider replacement only in this case.I asked them why is this not mentioned on the page promising 7 day replacement, to which they said that not all clauses can be mentioned in the Amazon website!! So, even if the screen is broken or for any other serious issues with laptop, you need to take an appointment and go to Apple store and get their approval for replacement.So, the 7 day replacement guarantee does not mean much for Apple products bought from Amazon. Better avoid buying apple products from Amazon."},

Below are the observations:1. Buying from Amazon - Got 5900 off on MRP plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. Checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. Thanks Amazon.2. User experience - Switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad HD and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. Compared to Windows the Mac experience is very smooth.3. Must say the previous HP laptops I bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. With Mac there is no compromise on quality.4. This has 2 ports only. The screen quality and trackpad are so good I ditched my plan to connect to external monitor Dell P2419H and logitech keyboard. Only use a M590 Logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. In fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean.All I can say is having used this Mac its well worth the price and way better than all the Windows laptops in the market.

As a first time Mac user, I would say, switching to Mac from Windows was a very good experience for me. I didn't face any major issues. All I can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels ON, the whole working day! I never felt that I lacked anything. Even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an Iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still ON.From performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. But do know that you'll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. But overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. I was bit disappointed with the Amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the OTP and he then calls up for it.

Absolutely no noise and no heating. Battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing, movie, youtube, streaming etc). If pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other PC.Updates on 14th Apr'22Well! Performance is still good but a big problem appeared in battery. Randomly shutting down with 74% battery left without any warning. It doesn't turn on until I plug the power adapter. When the laptop opens it shows battery at 11% and takes very little time (10-15 mins) to reach 100% battery level. Then after I unplug, from 100% to reach 74% it takes normal time (no abrupt drainage here), but once it goes around 74% it again shuts down, and the loop continues. However no problem while keeping on power. But this is not good sign from such a costly device. Not sure on if battery is required to be replaced. If someone knows a solution please let me know, this may help others also. Cheers !"},

For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for.

Its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the M1 chip. However, I was a bit disheartened when I came to know that lots of applications have blocked the M1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like Instagram, Netflix etc). Overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with MacOS then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 INR. Dell XPS with similar configuration is costlier than this. Go check youtube reviews for this machine to know more in details. Its your hard-earned money so make sure you invest in the right stuff."},

Apple has really broken ground with their processors- Thin and light form factor- QHD screen / Retina Display- The battery life is really good. That‚Äôs again thanks to the power efficiency of the M1. I could easily get an entire work day without a charger- Aluminium unibody- Magic keyboard and best in class trackpad- USB C charging point Cons:- Lack of ports and variety does hinder usage. I‚Äôm using it with a dock to connect to a monitor, keyboard and mouse- full charge takes time. This is a bummer in the age of fast charging products- can notice the slowdowns when there are too many browser tabs open. Killing some apps resolves this tho- the thin body is a double edged sword. It can flex when under pressure like in a bag. I had to diagonally apply pressure to straighten it.- while the USB C charging point is a boon, the magnetic charging port from older models is missed- 60Hz screen- Subpar cameraI upgraded from a 2013 MacBook Pro to this and I‚Äôm not disappointed but yes, there is room for improvement. I cannot do away with MacBooks because of the connected ecosystem and my work flow. Despite the demerits - can score this 4/5."},

I got it for 61k Rupees (roughly 600$ for non indians) on diwali sale including no cost emi discount of 10k. At this price point, its an absolute beast and a satisfying buy.Pros:Screen- The screen quality is superb. You would always want to stick to such screen. Content looks super punchy to look at. One of the best screen you will ever see.Performance - Simply put, M1 is a monster. It will perform every task smoothly whatever you throw at it. You are never gonna face any lag in day to day activities. There is a clear difference between apple and intel chips. It never heats up even without an inbuilt fan.Battery - OMG ! What a stunner battery this has. Never imagined laptop battery could last for 15-16 hours on a single charge. Moreover, it hardly sucks any battery on standby mode. Totally impressive.Physical appearance - Incredible. Its lighter than 90 percent of laptops out there. And so slim as well. Physical appearance of this laptop is like cherry over cake. It feels so good just to hold this beauty and work on it.Speakers - Wow ! Never thought speaker on a laptop can be this good. I am a big music fan and this machine lets me stop using my headphones.Cons: Pricey ! For storage of 256gb its costly. Its a very good deal if you get it for 60-65k INR just like i did.Also, gold color is so underrated. It looks so lovely."},

NEVER  ever again !", "review": "After having been an avid windows user through HP/dell laptops , I too got bitten by the bug of owning an apple product . So went and bought an apple MacBook Air with MI chip in sep 21 . First impressions were : wow , such a beautiful piece , great display , great sound quality etc etc . Needed adjustment to working with a mac after being with windows throughout but saw that as a thing I would eventually overcome . Fast forward 4 months of usage and despite the extreme delicate handling of the laptop , one fine day without any cause , suddenly the display went off and I started seeing a blank screen . Spoke to apple customer care , was directed to got to the local service centre , went there only to be told that warranty doesn‚Äôt hold in this case as the display would fall under accidental damage . Accident ???But when did that happen ? It neither fell down , neither did I keep anything heavy on it nor did I close it , nor was it being charged at that time !!!! . tried telling this to the service centre , then called up the customer care , shared the pics of the display and asked the same thing again , how can they call it an accident when no accident has happened , Got the best reply ever : Only you know or God knows how it happened . Wow , what a wonderful reply ! Apple is out of it . It‚Äôs between you and the grand master now . So what do I do now ? Get the display repaired at a cost of Rs 32,000 . Wait ! what ? 32 k ?So guys , I have had a very bad experience with the product as well as with the service centre and customer care . I am wary of getting the display repaired since I don‚Äôt know what caused the damage in the first place so what is the guarantee that the repaired screen will not suffer the same damage again .Now I am back to searching for a new HP / dell /Lenovo laptop for myself . Missing the sturdiness , economical maintenance ( a new display in this would cost abt 5k) and the windows interface . Bye Bye MacBook. And thanks to Apple for the worst support and care for their customers ."},

{"name": "Mayank Tiwari", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Everything you need at this price!", "review": "I got this to replace my 7 years old Windows laptop and the difference is massive. This thing sprints past anything you throw at it. I primarily use it for my office work added to the Photoshop and Premier Pro edits in bits and pieces. It is unbelievably capable and efficient for a laptop that does not even have a fan to stop it from thermal throttling. I am listing down some of the pros and cons that I had found on using it for my daily tasks.Pros:1. Superfast M1 Chip. Nothing in the market at this price compares to what it does.2. Display: It is gorgeous. Windows laptops at this price give you a 1080p at max and this is 2560x1600. True Tone adds fire to it.3. Apple ecosystem: If you have an iPad or an iPhone, using devices together is effortless.4. Battery Life: It is insane. I am getting 12+ hours of SOT regularly with mixed usage. Having to charge a laptop once in 2 days increases its practicality exponentially.5. Design: It is flawless, sleek and lightweight.6. Trackpad: You dont see people talking about this part of MacBooks quite often but I think we should. It is amazing, the taptic feedback, the precision and the gestures are so good that you will never feel like going back to a physical mouse.Cons:1. Ports: The biggest issue for me is the lack of ports on this MacBook having only 2 USB-C and a 3.5mm audio jack, you sure need to buy an adapter right away to use almost everything with it.2. Camera: The 720p camera in 2021 sucks. It is not acceptable even with the optimisations Apple brought in with Big Sur.3. The price: The base model is only 256 GB and additional RAM or SSD costs a fortune.At last, I think if your usage is medium to heavy load on a regular basis, you should rather go for the Pro which has a fan to reduce the chances of thermal throttling causing a drop in performance. For everyone else, this laptop is more than you need."},
{"name": "anish", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "MacBook Air - This is my first MAC laptop.", "review": "Alright, I have been a long time Windows User, and I must say that this laptop has been quite amazing. I mostly use this for minor video editing, using my cloud apps, working on my projects, coding and development, and for watching videos and browsing constantly. I had slightly dipped my toe in the Apple ecosystem back in 2020 when I had purchased an Ipad, which became my main computer for web browsing and reading books device. It also made me not use my main Windows computer even less as pretty much 60 percent of my workflow was transferred to my iPad. Now this MacBook has become my main device for basically every computing task I can think of. The typing experience has been stellar, quite simply the best keyboard on a laptop hands down! Also the built quality and the hinge design of this laptop made me feel safe to use this as frequently as I want and for as long as I want.My experience with Windows was on a sharp decline from being quite usable to getting in the way of my productivity. The amount of maintenance that my Windows PC requires was mind boggling, especially towards the end of its life cycle. This laptop was preceded by a computer with an FX 6300 chip and 8 gigs of RAM. So naturally, this was just a massive improvement. This laptop has scored 3 times the score of my previous computer on GeekBench. I can feel that difference in general usability and I personally feel that by daily drivering this laptop I have become a part of a revolution in the computing space. The apps in this mac have never taken more than 5 seconds to boot. Doesnt matter if the app is x86 or an ARM based app, all of them are super optimised. Also almost every general app has a 64 bit version out now so you can have that app in your system regardless. Now I realise that most people who will be buying this laptop are going to be either artists or developers, but even if you are a general user who wants a decent computer to learn stuff on or to use it for spreadsheet or document work, then this laptop is value for money, provided you have the budget for it. However, you do pay the Apple Tax with this product much like you do with every other product that the company has released in the country. If you can get it from US or UK, it is worth getting from there as you will obviously save copious amounts of money and you can also redeem the 1 year of international warranty should the need arise."},
{"name": "susheel chandra", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Most affordable laptop in the category", "review": "Although my purchase doesn't show it as verified, I have bought the MacBook Air on Amazon.I have transitioned from windows to Apple MacBook knowing that it's the first time that an apple device is actually value for money . This MacBook simply put just feels like a high end mobile phone. It's so smooth, buttery animations, excellent trackpad, excellent battery life and performance.Things that impressed me instantly:1. Display2. Speakers3. Trackpad4. Build Quality (Dense and strong)5. Battery life6. Performance7. Safari8. Wifi 6Yes, I was confused for a day but got used to whole macos and as a windows user once you get used to the macOS, you will start appreciating the laptop even more. OS wise, I would still like windows for office work. Air would be the best personal laptop where I am doing a lot of browsing and some coding for personal use. I dislike the folder structure and files part on Mac OS, so it's a no go for me for professional use unless I am forced to use it in the office.Issues:1. Absolutely nothingThis is not a specs game but what Apple is offering for 90k is much much more than the comparable laptops on the windows side. You cannot beat the build quality and smoothness on Mac.I am very impressed and hopefully the previous versions are nothing like this or else I would be disappointed that I didn't get this machine earlierUpdate after 1 month of usage:1.) Facing download issues in app store sometimes where the download speed is too slow. I think this is mac os 11.2.3 issue2.) Display is 2.7k and is crisp for a laptop. Speakers sound great. I have tried my headphones and BT earphones, both seem to have enhanced sound quality while using on a Mac. Maybe they have put a quality DAC.3.) Can't install windows through bootcamp, can do with parallels but parallels is expensive.4.) The default office apps are of no use (pages, numbers etc). I am currently using libre office but office 365 would be great. If you buy windows laptop of similar price, most probably you will get office suite for free5.) Some apps don't work well, they keep crashing (ex: Spotify, Twitter).6.) For basic use, I think nobody needs a macbook air, because there is good amount of downside if you are transitioning from windows. If you are into video editing or coding, I would highly recommend this product.7.) iPhone and iPad apps suck. Don't even need to download.8.) You can't play games because of Apple's decision . Apple arcade and apple tv+ have disappointing games and tv shows. Not worth paying a pennyVerdict: I feel the app transition from intel based to arm architecture is still incomplete and has a lot of scope for improvement. If these base laptops are going to be the cheapest in the line till next year, I would recommend you to buy else look for later editions which are rumoured to come with mini led display and more ports with more processing power."},

{"name": "Kamala gude", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "The best!!", "review": "The hardest part about buying a macbook air or any apple product for that matter is not worrying about the price, but choosing the colour.Initially, looking at the photos, I thought gold would look nice and unique but when I went to the store and checked it, it seemed to be very cheap and tacky. However, at the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference.Anyway, this left me with two options, namely, silver and space grey.Silver seemed a little too plain and boring and it kinda looked like all the other models and was a bit over-contrasting. So I ended up picking space grey. Although people online mentioned it to be dull, when I went and checked it out in the store, it looked super classy.Before ordering on Amazon, I'd highly recommend you to first go to the store and check the colours out. Don't rely on the photos online.Also, don't be apprehensive about purchasing on Amazon cause u will get a genuine product. Make sure to check your serial number on the Apple website. Plus, to avoid scratches, refrain from using laptop bags with zips and avoid wearing watches or jewellery while using it.This is by far the best laptop I've ever come across. It's worth spending those extra 15-20k. Don't even think while choosing macbook vs windows. No windows laptop could ever come close to macbook air.Also, refrain from buying the latest macbook pros worth 1.5l+. They're so not worth the amount you're paying. Most features are exactly the same as air and there's no major difference except for the touch bar which is crap in my opinion."},
{"name": "Manav S.", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Value for money purchase", "review": "This is one of the best laptop I have used in the recent times. Whatever other positive reviews have stated is totally correct. Best thing about this laptop is that it stays cool no matter what you do. It has the best battery backup out there. I am getting around 14-15 hours on a single charge. The display is top notch with great viewing angles and good brightness levels. The output from speakers is a melody to your ears. I won't say a word about the chip. I think even after m1 pro is released, this would be the one that will sell in numbers because former would cost around 2 lakh in India. Most of the softwares are now available for Aarch64. I am a developer and still haven't installed Rosetta 2. Recommend to use Safari as your daily browser as it saves a lot of battery life and it's blazing fast. Will add a 3 month review after some time."},

Although expensive, its worth the price if you can afford to buy one. I am most impressed with the mini led display. Here are some pros and cons I found:-Pro‚Äôs1. The display. You get the better xdr display on this machine than the pro display xdr.2. M1 pro has the perfect balance of battery and power. M1 max has higher gpu performance but takes a chunk of your battery as well. Ymmv.3. Speakers. It‚Äôs loud, clear and has a ton of low end. Thoroughly impressed.4. It‚Äôs a quiet machine and doesn‚Äôt get hot.5. Lack of touchbar.6. It looks much more sleek in person.Con‚Äôs1. Magsafe is too tight. It takes your machine with you if you pull the cable at a straight angle.2. Camera smoothes your face too much. Looks average.3. Notch is an eyesore but you get used to it.4. Safari doesn‚Äôt support 120hz for some reason. Apps in general needs updating for 120hz.5. Hdmi 2.0 instead of 2.1, 4k 120hz not possible from hdmi port.Overall, it‚Äôs almost a perfect laptop if you know how to utilise its potential.Great job apple."},

{"name": "Sanchit Khandelwal", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "title": "Excellent All Round Laptop", "review": "I was really torn between MBA and Asus Zephyrus G14 in the festival sale; both were coming at a great price and are really good at what they do. I was a little biased towards G14 initially due to familiarity of windows and since it can game as well. But finally, after much deliberation I went with MBA, since it does all the basics so well and got it an excellent price of 71k in the sale!And boy, oh boy! What a good decision that has been. The battery life, high resolution screen, speakers and overall build quality are all excellent. I regularly get more than 12 hrs of battery life in my daily use, the machine is always on and wakes up in less than a second. It also never got hot with my daily use, even without a fan. The Mac OS did take some time to get used to it but is overall a very polished OS. I would recommend any prospective buyer to watch a few YouTube videos to familiarize them with it to ease the transition.Overall its a great laptop and you can't go wrong with it, unless you are working on some specific software which doesn't have a Mac OS substitute or unless you like to game on your primary machine."},

I am very impressed with the battery back up and processing power of this machine. I had to buy a connector for various ports which is a pain as this version has only 3 ports. 2 USB-C on one side and a 3.5 mm audio jack on the other side. The display is awesome and clear. This version is a little heavier than 2017 Macbook air though. 256 GB sdd space was enough for me as I have external sdd and hdd where I store most of my data. The charger is different from the earlier Macbook Air 2017. Firstly there is no separate extension cable as was with 2017 Air. The charger is a USB -C charger and after connecting the charger only one USB -C port remains free for use which makes a connector must. The connector that I purchased had 2 male USB C ports on one side to connect and 2 USB - C female, 2 USB - A female, MMC Card female and HDMI female port on other ends. The Air comes with MacOS Big Sur pre installed."},
