Rajan Dimri,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressed with Performance, Disappointed with Camera Quality - Apple 2020 MacBook Air","I recently purchased the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip and I must say, I'm quite impressed with its performance. The M1 chip is a game-changer and offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, making it a joy to use. The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals that are easy on the eyes. The laptop comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage, which offers ample space to store files and run multiple applications without any lag. The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality for virtual meetings.One of the standout features of this laptop is the Touch ID feature. It is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords. This feature, combined with the overall speed and efficiency of the M1 chip, makes for a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices.However, there are a few drawbacks to this laptop that led me to give it a 4-star rating. Firstly, the laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks, such as video editing or running multiple applications simultaneously. This can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes even affect performance. Secondly, the battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage. This is a bit of a letdown, as one of the key benefits of the M1 chip was supposed to be its efficiency and battery life.Finally, the lack of ports is a bit of a drawback. The laptop only comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means that users will need to purchase additional dongles or hubs to connect other devices. This can be inconvenient and adds to the overall cost of the laptop. Additionally, the absence of an SD card slot is a bit of a bummer, as it is a commonly used port by photographers and videographers.In conclusion, the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a great investment and offers a lot of features and benefits, but it does have some drawbacks. It is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications. Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-performance laptop that offers speed, efficiency, and convenience.Bullet points:The M1 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiencyThe 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visualsThe Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video qualityThe Touch ID feature is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwordsThe laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devicesThe laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasksThe battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usageThe lack of ports, particularly the absence of an SD card slot, is a bit of a drawback"
Erick Franky,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For office use and watching movies, its great!",Its still the M1 but it beats the intel macbook air.Also it doesn‚Äôt overheat and its very smooth to work with. Display is good. Performance is good. I don‚Äôt use it for heavy work but i have done some tests and it can do rendering very fast. It packs quite a punch and i love using it. Its lightweight and the battery lasts for a long time.
Omkar Apte,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing piece of Tech,"Bought it during summer sale and with generous cash back of 3000 I felt it was a good deal for those without any credit card.Regarding the Mac its simply beautiful, with its all metal/ aluminium body, amazing keys and gorgeous display its a joy to use.The OS on other side will take some time getting used to. But have to say it definitely looks more polished and slick compared to Windows 11."
Vedanta Banerjee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have the budget for it, GO FOR IT!","The media could not be loaded. ¬†An absolute pleasure using this laptop! I have been an windows user for the last 13years and yeah switching is a bit difficult at first but after a few days, this becomes a productive beast. Things get done soo quicker, smoother with the 8Core M1 CPU and 7Core GPU. The screen is absolutely stunning and the sound is really good. This has been the best purchase!! I guess this has turned me into a apple fanboy lol"
Srihari,4.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best tech gadget I have ever used till 2023,"MacBook Air m1 (8GB, 256 GB) - Gold variantMy thoughts on after using for 1 year still the best for the budget spent on laptop. It has amazing battery life, instant wake up time from screen lock, software updates, good for media consumption for long time, no stutters while using and executing code with IT softwares, sidecar, mirroring to apple devices is smooth, universal control. And I have stopped using iPad once I bought MacBook.Only issue I faced was the charger included in box is faulty. when plugged in to wall socket to laptop, can feel the laptop body getting shock. I have purchased dual usb c charger from apple and using it. charger quality could have been better during quality checks."
Poornima,5.0 out of 5 stars,An actual laptop which doesn't burn your lap,"I get 6-8hrs of screen on time with wifi and bluetooth so actually portable as I dont need to carry charger everywhere and when I close it on friday and open it Monday battery percentage is only decreased 1-2% unbelievable why can't windows laptops be like this? all windows laptops I used is zero battery by Monday morning. Not all positive sometimes I see beachball with teamviewer and notes app updates didnt fix it yet.Apple alternatives for MS office is not upto mark, word documents have fonts scrambled so have to install MS office for office work anyway."
Dipanshu ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had issues, now it's resolved.","1. laptop is getting off below 80% battery life and suddenly showing 10% battery life, after plugging the adapter suddenly showing 70-80% battery life. 2. This issue was from the beginning the battery life was in normal condition then i updated the software again and reset the smc now its working fine."
SELJI THOMAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mind blowing purchase,Wua.... better than any Intel based laptops costs between 60k to 1L
chetndas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery life and RAM management,"Got it for 80K in last sale after all discounts combined. Received securely packed, and brand new no issues there. Here are some pros and cons you may want to consider:1. Wonderful battery life: Most amazing feature of this laptop - can take it outdoors, with full screen brightness, and heavy workload (heavy programs running with 7GB / 8GB RAM used), it gives 8-10 hours or even more (haven't tried sitting all day outdoors).2. Great screen: Better than my Mi notebook pro, that too has good screen, but this one is brighter and crispier and the difference is well noted in bright sunlight.3. RAM management: I run chrome with 8-10 tabs open, heavy programs running that takes 14GB / 16GB RAM in my Mi notebok pro, this one manages it with 7GB / 8GB RAM. That's all. I felt some lag opening photoshop, 2-3 seconds delay clicking open button and actually opening of photoshop application, but I don't mind it. Comparing processing with my Mi notebook pro i5 with 16 GB RAM, this one is comparable.4. Light weight and slim: At cost of slightly smaller screen.Conclusion: This tool will get you through your general and programming needs with mac os."

Wellwoven (Murlimohan),5.0 out of 5 stars,best laptop for BUSINESS,"this laptop is best for business purposes, with excellent battery backup, a crystal clear display.overall it is a very very lovely experience with MACBOOK AIR M1.Thanks, APPLE"
Dhineshkumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Product,"i was using macbook air early 2015 before. It was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. But i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to M1 Mac in exchange offer. I got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.After i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. Excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. Excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. Excellent display qualityI did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. Only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. You need a cleaning cloth always with you which I am carrying with me all the time with IPA liquid for better cleaning performance. But i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. Also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is onI thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually I purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. Luckily it was damaged on transit. After that again I did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. Hence, I claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased IP liquid to clean the screen.If you're a frequent traveler along with MacBook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it's not cleaned periodically. So, I purchased IP liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. It costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power IP liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from DMART). I believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. This liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the Screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees"

Sanjeev,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely fine product,This is my first MacBook. And I love using it. Quality is absolutely perfect to meet all of the requirements such as coding and video editing.Although MacBook is very good but it has only one drawback that is it has 256gb of storage memory which is very less as compared to windows laptops.Performance wise it has no lag at all.‚ù§Ô∏è MacBook Air M1‚ù§Ô∏è
gour,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for your buck,"Most value for money laptop right now ... amazing performance, got a good deal, for around 66K...."
Labhansh Satpute,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for Money Product,
Anubhav Nautiyal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bittersweet experience,"This is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do."
LEENUS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,Nice
vivek rm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth of money !!,I used MacBook Pro 13 inch of intel but this M1 chip from Air is too fast and quick response with better battery life.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pocket rocket this Laptop is,"I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?"
Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,My second purchase & I love it,"This is my second Macbook Air purchase. So far, I'm loving it."
abhishek,4.0 out of 5 stars,If you're a student go for it .,"It's a very laptop üíª but here are some of my observations.Screen: The screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading PDFs, browsing images etc. It's a pleasant experience to eyes .Battery: Although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.On the first initial days I was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which I guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air's battery hardware. But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months."

Vagmi Saras Pvt Ltd,5.0 out of 5 stars,ONE OF THE BEST IN ALL THE ASPECT.,"MacBook Air is one of favourite from 2017 classy to handle, classic battery life very easy and convenient to use, 100% recommended."
Ben,5.0 out of 5 stars,Longterm review Fanless Wonder,"I had fears about getting a laptop with passive cooling, even though I don't do video editing or compile big programs on the Air, even for web development and writing small scripts a fanless laptop seemed like a bad idea but after using this I can this thing is totally fine and wonderfulDocker works fine some issues do come up but for simple development of C++, Python apps along with Postgres SQL docker with some configurations the M1 chip has so far caused no issues.I run vscode, pycharm the project is not too huge but with safari or chrome running with 6-8 tabs this wonder does not heat up or cause any instability.The display is the best I have used so far, the speakers are far better than equivalent windows laptopsSome Cons:1) No simple keyboard shortcut to control keyboard backlighting,2) As a long-term windows user, the shortcuts like arrow key + Win key to resize apps/stack apps is something I truly miss, Mac does have its own multitasking/split screen way but I prefer windows installing a third party for this seems unnecessary3) Battery life on 12.4 is a bit less than when I got the MacBook Air4) Switching to Mac shortcuts takes a bit of time5) Need to buy a type C Dongle, as I work of ethernet port mostly"

ashish,5.0 out of 5 stars,M1 8gb vs 16gb confusion?,"Should i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? This was the question i had for a long time. After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.Why i opted for 8gb ram?My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too.I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture.So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging üòä).I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.***update after 10 months *****No regrets! This is super fast engine. I do a lot of coding now with this. I feel every software works like a charm in M1 now. Of course we have the updated processor now. This is a start of a super powerful engine"

AshishT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very reliable and worth of each penny spent,"Hi, I have been an apple user- still have an old 2011 model. Then i switched back to dell for around 4 years. It's all good and smooth with Dell. And very recently I thought let me buy myself an Air. I like that its super sleek and somehow grey color is one of my favourites. So no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery). The only con of apple air is that its pricey but yes (if you are like me-you will realise its soon that in a long run, how this becomes such an important part of your life, its much more cheaper in value)Super Pro's1. M1 processors are highly efficient in processing. Also thanks to SSD2. Battery life is crazy- last for 15-16 hours easily3. Look and Design (there's not much to say- its very obvious)- Super classy, sleek and very light weight.Con's1. No consIt's the best version of any Macbooks till date.To be honest, I do multiple things- I design, I edit videos, I code, and I browse. Everything is good. I wish I could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. So I treated myself with a very handy Seagate SSD 500 GB and I use it on the fly. Something extra to carry but I still LOVE it.Also, to let you know that- this is one of my first review that's written so throughly. So understand the excitement and satisfaction level of this product.WISH YOU LUCK! Now go and Buy. :)"

Krishna,4.0 out of 5 stars,"APPLE M1 2020 IS A GOOD LAPTOP AS A HARDWARE PIECE, BUT SOFTWARE PLATFORM SUCKS.","Apple Macbook M1 2020 edition is an excellent piece of hardware bundle but the software platform is not suitable for many of the applications which work only on Windows PC. If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device.Pros:* Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left milesbeyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.* The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low powerconsumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop. The entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting.* Battery lasts very loooong, even for HQ 16 K video playback.* Display is very realistic with true colours.* Sound quality is great. Channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with soundscoming from all directions, far and near.Cons:* Very poor or no scope for expanding the RAM and storage size.* Software is expensive.* Additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive.* Such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty.* Other than 2 C type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. One C port is engaged forpower supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed ""C"" type USB port.* Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned. Compatibility, storage space, expandability areseverely constrained.Finally, like the PC's which can take MS Windows OS and also other OS platforms, Apple range of MacBooks should also be compatible universally for all platforms, with hardware expandability options like PCs.with any Operating systems."
Kumar Gourab Pattanaik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its like ... You own a Beast... Superb Machine,It is so faster than windows laptop. And download and upload are just a click away. I was using Windows now became a macbook user and i am fully satisfied with Macbook Air M1.It's a total different machine for Windows Users but it is faster and secure than Windows.. Just Go For It.....
Bhanu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unreal,"This is the device that got me into Apple ecosystem, and this is a piece of peak engineering and worth every rupee I spent.No fans means the inside is completely isolated from the outside so no dust inside.Speakers and display are top notch. You can go for Mi Notebook with similar screen resolution but this one does not cause eye strain.Trackpad is one of the best I used.Battery life is unreal.Not for gaming though. If you are using it for just media consumption and some general programming then you will not feel it getting hot ever.Considering the price difference between M1 and M2 models, this is a better choice if you do not want to spend nearly 50% more on M2 Air."
Anirban M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for casual personal use,"Probably the best productivity gadget in this price segment (so called pro phones cost more than this). Has great display, one of the best speaker, super portability and bunch of useful, yet free Apple softwares. For personal use this is just appropriate. Though it has 8 GBs of RAM; I tried GarageBand with my MiDi keyboard, multiple HD video editing in iMovie and it worked almost perfectly. And the best part is wake up feature. No matter how many days after I open the lid, the screen wakes up for action just instantly. Truely this feature is amazing.P.S. Amazon did not accept my old laptop for exchange, despite it being in working condition; saying the battery backup needs to be at least 1 hour. My old laptop was an HCL one, that they agreed on. And HCL stopped production 4 years ago. How can you ask for 1 hour of backup from such a laptop ... ü§£"
Artistic Brain,4.0 out of 5 stars,Apple is at it again!,"I have been using the Macbook 13,3 inches for almost a year now. It works extremely fast and is very smooth, the keys are great to type on. Though it has a good software and mostly good hardware, the camera quality is horrible. Its very blocky and the pixels are extremely visible. For the price, you can maybe get a better windows laptop but I have been a hardcore apple fan.Overall, I give it a 4.5 out of 5, it runs extremely smoothly even with multiple windows,tabs,apps etc open. My favourite part is the constant updates that apple provides that always upgrade the features and exemplify the user experience! I hope this helps =D."

"Kamal Gupta,  New Delhi",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful laptop,"I got a golden one. It is rose gold and not truly gold in colour but its looks are mesmerising. The performance is cool. The only drawback is that there are only two type c ports. If one is used for charging and the other is used to connect the mouse then virtually you are left with no other port for a pen drive or printer. There is space where they could have given more ports.What I liked the most was the reduced bezels and scissors on the keyboard due to which the size of the laptop got reduced without compromising the 13.3-inch screen size. The screen is good, speed is fast, and beauty has increased, however, some may miss the glowing apple logo which has been replaced with a metal Apple logo. Speaker is crisp loud and clear.I like it"

Dheeraj Kumar Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pricewise best laptop money can buy,Mac user since last 7 yrs and this is too relevant even in 2022
Sparsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional Laptop for the price,"M1 is phenomenal in terms of performance and efficiency. It just works without any hiccups. Battery life is excellent. Easily a two day laptop with light to moderate use. If you are in the Apple ecosystem, go for it with eyes closed.Moreover, almost all apps have a universal binary now which targets ARM architecture specifically (instead of x86), which basically means more performance in all of these apps. So if you used this laptop more than a year ago and found bugs with the software, be rest assured that the bugs are no more and macOS is very stable now on this machine."
Athul,3.0 out of 5 stars,Never Buy Apple Products from Amazon!,"I faced a small issue related to the new macbook air I bought from Amazon. I was considering whether to request for replacement or not and I called Amazon customer care. What surprised me, was the response from Amazon customer care. They said if there is any issue with Apple products bought from Amazon, you need to first present it to the Apple store within the replacement period, i.e. 7 days. Apple store should give a certificate telling that there is an issue with the product. Amazon will consider replacement only in this case.I asked them why is this not mentioned on the page promising 7 day replacement, to which they said that not all clauses can be mentioned in the Amazon website!! So, even if the screen is broken or for any other serious issues with laptop, you need to take an appointment and go to Apple store and get their approval for replacement.So, the 7 day replacement guarantee does not mean much for Apple products bought from Amazon. Better avoid buying apple products from Amazon."
Ashish Malik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Nice product by Apple
Deepak Rajan,5.0 out of 5 stars,MacBook Air M1 - Outstanding Machine,"Having used Dell/HP laptops only this was the first Mac experience. Below are the observations:1. Buying from Amazon - Got 5900 off on MRP plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. Checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. Thanks Amazon.2. User experience - Switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad HD and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. Compared to Windows the Mac experience is very smooth.3. Must say the previous HP laptops I bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. With Mac there is no compromise on quality.4. This has 2 ports only. The screen quality and trackpad are so good I ditched my plan to connect to external monitor Dell P2419H and logitech keyboard. Only use a M590 Logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. In fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean.All I can say is having used this Mac its well worth the price and way better than all the Windows laptops in the market. Beware once you use this you would probably not want to touch a windows laptop again."
Brensten Vaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little overpriced in India, but worth the money as an apple product!","Skipping the technical part since I'm sure most know about the M1 chip already. As a first time Mac user, I would say, switching to Mac from Windows was a very good experience for me. I didn't face any major issues. All I can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels ON, the whole working day! I never felt that I lacked anything. Even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an Iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still ON.From performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. But do know that you'll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. But overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. I was bit disappointed with the Amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the OTP and he then calls up for it. But apart from this, a great purchase!"
RISHAB GHOSH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best laptop out there, Macbook air m1","Insanely powerful and starkly, very efficient too. Easily lasts a week after full charging. The M1 is a beast and handles everything smoothly. The finish, feel and look is top notch premium just as you expect from Apple products. The display is gorgeous crisp and has a high contrast, the sound quality is excellent too. Its really the best laptop not just at this price point but even above. This is a machine you should buy if you are looking for a laptop at this price range. Apple just makes beautiful powerful machines and this one is just on another level. The M1 chip is a revolution. Yes there‚Äôs a learning curve when you switch from Windows to Macintosh but nothing which can‚Äôt be learnt. Unless you are really bent on using Windows only, this is the laptop to go for."
Pacific,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice purchase,"It‚Äôs working nicely and smoothly (like butter) right now. Been using it for 6 months now.Big pros: Smoothness, üëåüèª aesthetics, fantastic integration with my cellphone & other ecosystem devices e.g. Airpods, sound free/fan free (literally) cool operationBig cons: Price (not sure if its VFM in India for such a pricey cost unless it runs smoothly for minimum of 5-6 years), Camera quality, low space given, low RAM & its feature of swapping onto SSD ROM which will wear/fail it out sooner.Above Average: Battery, Screen quality, sound.Below Average: Battery- if you use non-Apple apps like Chrome on it much, Lack of I/O ports is frustrating, the tight ecosystem which stifles flexibility and options for the user.Overall, it‚Äôs fine till now. I remember I started having issue with my previous machine (Dell) within a year (charging cable/battery/screen) and then it repeated every 3 years; so I have long term to go before finally giving my verdict for this M1 Macbook."
Pranab Roy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Value Buy from Amazon

Avishek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money so far,"My first Mac, so far had no issues, in 15 days hanged once for 15 secs during shutdown, else everything is good. Absolutely no noise and no heating. Battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing, movie, youtube, streaming etc). If pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other PC.Updates on 14th Apr'22Well! Performance is still good but a big problem appeared in battery. Randomly shutting down with 74% battery left without any warning. It doesn't turn on until I plug the power adapter. When the laptop opens it shows battery at 11% and takes very little time (10-15 mins) to reach 100% battery level. Then after I unplug, from 100% to reach 74% it takes normal time (no abrupt drainage here), but once it goes around 74% it again shuts down, and the loop continues. However no problem while keeping on power. But this is not good sign from such a costly device. Not sure on if battery is required to be replaced. If someone knows a solution please let me know, this may help others also. Cheers !"
Aby Chackiath,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinking of Laptop/Notebook - Don't look further,"if you are a person who ever thought of buying a high performance laptop at a great bargain, this is it !

Karthikeyan C P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product from apple,"Nice product. sleek, nice screen, battery power. first time apple user. can already see the difference in the screen clarity switching from pc. Also battery life is better in mac. I'm finally using the laptop the way its used to function - without cord. my old pc drains so much battery that you need to plug the wire as the day progresses. It has progressively gone worse and now needs a new battery within 4 years of use. I hope mac lasts much longer than that. its a bit pricy though but worth the price. hope it helps"
Anurag,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's an investment.,Buying apple laptop is an investment for me. If you have money then please go for it. It will give you great productivity. Battery life is awesome.Do not buy it for watching YouTube and movies (ignore this if you are parents rich).
Placeholder,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop ever created,"This machine truly deserves the price tag we pay. We often think that Apple products are super expensive, and yes, they are, but they provide extraordinary value.1-Like the very high quality SSD that runs at 3000mbps,2-built like a tank with such a thin form factor,3-and speakers, man, you never¬†had speakers on a laptop ever like that. They are just perfect.4-The screen is a 2K with very good brightness and the best possible colour accuracy.¬†I guess at this price, no other brand offers this level of display.5-The battery needs no introduction; it's above¬†16 hours in my¬†tests, .6-And the M1, again, a laptop with this CPU can even be compared¬†with a high-end desktop,7-And as for the last MacOS, it's the most polished OS I've ever used.Everything you get on an Apple product is of very high quality."

Rajesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant as expected, but go for 512 GD drive","The Macbook air is really cool and works without any glitches. Some personal learnings for me. If you want to install MS teams, without a second thought go for 512 GB configuration as Teams is asking for 263GB space on the hard disk which is more than what the default 256 GB. Second learning is about Safari stopping auto refresh for sites like trading view charts, to save power. Need to explore how to disable such power saving for browser."
Polo ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∞üèª,5.0 out of 5 stars,No one can beat Apple,"Honest review!If you ever dream a laptop with fastest ever in terms of speed while opening the screen, no lag, Quality (picture and sound) the performance, Highly top Notch!

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Precious Asset,"I was very happy with my decision to go with Apple instead of other brands. It is very handy to work and move along, no heating issues at all, battery life is unbelievable, almost for 15 hours plus, which is very convenient. It‚Äôs life expectancy is more than other brands, a quality product with neat finish and looks very premium. Only downside is USB hubs, one need to buy an USB C external hub. Thanks Apple for making such a great product Apple MacBook Air M1.Camera not tested yet."

Ankit Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall A great Purchase.,"Writing this review after 3 weeks of purchase. Laptop is brand new and working great. No problem or issues with the performance (run benchmark test), you can easily do multitasking without any lag/delay. Since I am a software developer I tried with 6-7 microservices running side by side on the IDE. All were running smoothly.The battery last long for approx 12-13 hrs of continuous use without shut down.Slightly disappointed with the web cam, it's 720p, but better than other brands with same resolution.Overall a great experience with a great brand. Go for it."

Akbar,5.0 out of 5 stars,An engineering Marvel !!!,Battery life (15hrs) is like nothing I have seen before but this is only if u run native apps or the ones optimised otherwise it will drain quickly but still manage to give you around 10 hrs.

tech geek,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's alien technology,"Pros:-1. It's Superfast. It will feel fast on everything - from bootup, to app opening, to builds etc.2. It's slim. Air has no fan hence it's form factor is even slimmer than Pro.3. It remains cold even during heavy code builds. It's hard to find things which makes it warm actually.4. I have tried several graphics heavy games and they run great without any heat as well5. If you are just browsing with Wifi on, typically it loses 10% battery in 7-8 hours. But it's for Safari browser. It has achieved I guess what people will call power-efficiency nirvana.6. Screen, Sound and Mic quality are awesomeCons:-1. Since it's winters in India now, some people might not like that it doesn't heat up the surroundings2. For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for. But ask yourself - whether you are gonna do that at all.3. Camera is 720p and that sucks about every other laptop as well. But Apple has brought some software optimisations which will make it look better4. It doesn't make sound of fan, so you might feel asleep if you are used that to keep track of your ML jobs.Apple started a revolution with this. Go for it, it's worth it."
Deepak Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"This is the second apple laptop which I have purchased after Macbook Pro 2015 retina model and due to budget constraint I went with MCA istead MBP. But still this MCA has blown away my mind all thanks to M1 chip. Great display quality, sleek design, light weight, super speed, good sound quality are some of the pros of this product. All together it was good purchase decision hence go for it and you'll never regret the purchase. But remeber officially this is Mac OS and not Windows OS."

S Zeet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super performance,"I have been using for about two weeks and I am very happy with the performance this Laptop gives.There are only three things which I‚Äôm not comfortable with,1. When you open the laptop, you will need both hands, one to hold down the base part of the laptop and another to hold the lid else you will lift the laptop instead of opening.2. The caps lock key is bit tight to press, not like other keys. But it still works fine, I just have to press a little harder then I press other keys. I don‚Äôt think this is an issue with all the macbook.3. The USB ports are to closed to each other. It gives me some problem when I wanted two USB device in a same time.Other then these, I am very happy."

Shivani,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect machine for daily use,"I am writing this review after a month of purchase. The apple m1 chip makes everything so much better. A lot of people told me that MacBook Air m1 is very close to the pro. Now I see why. The battery life is shockingly too good for an apple device. I use the laptop for browsing, emails, watching content and MS office; all of this runs flawlessly on this machine. The design is beautiful. The photos don‚Äôt do justice to the actual gold colour. I brought gold because space grey wasn‚Äôt available even after a long wait but I‚Äôm glad that happened because this is a rose gold colour and it looks splendid.This machine is worth every penny even without discounts, but if you get it with some credit card discount or good exchange deal like I did, don‚Äôt wait at all."

ASHWANI KUMAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best laptop out there !,"Besides being a beauty and extremely lightweight, this laptop is full of features which put it ahead of all other laptops.1.

You dont have to lug the charger everywhere with the laptop.Other laptops dont even come close.2. Speakers- Great surround sound speakers make listening to music/watching movies a great experience/3. Speed - The startup and apps are superfast."
Ravi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product and lightening speed.,What to say about the MacBook. The name is enough in itself. The laptop battery life is astounding. It remains super cool in winters as it has aluminium body.What we expect more from apple is an inbuilt MS office for MacBook

Amit Subodh,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't ask for more,The M1 Chip has brought a revolution in the Apple Eco System.

The new laptop gives me satisfaction and value for money. Hope it stays with me for the next 5 years.
Abhisek Dhar,4.0 out of 5 stars,No doubt its a good laptop,"The Macbook Air 2020 with M1 Chip is definitely a great laptop to buy for personal usage. Its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the M1 chip. However, I was a bit disheartened when I came to know that lots of applications have blocked the M1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like Instagram, Netflix etc). Overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with MacOS then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 INR. Dell XPS with similar configuration is costlier than this. Go check youtube reviews for this machine to know more in details. Its your hard-earned money so make sure you invest in the right stuff."

The battery life is better than your mobile phone 8hrs on heavy usage 12hrs on medium and more on just light usage.But you have to spend extra on USB type C Hub for more ports. This is a big draw back and you have to buy MS office separately. Just include it into your budget.Need not to go for 16GB RAM even for video editing or gaming. 8GB works great and there is no heating issue at all, save your bucks. Best among the lot. In today's date M1 processor is the best as per the performance and wattage consumption.I will recommend it."

I think response time is pretty more comparing to my previous HP intel i5 10th gen. but overall it‚Äôs good looking and very handy.

Amitabh D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic laptop, slightly expensive in India.","The speed with which native apps open is amazing, the battery life is fantastic.You will need to spend more money on the right connectors etc, especially if you want a desktop setup. My Thunderbolt 2 monitor has a lot of USB-A ports to connect my mouse and keyboard and all I had to get was the (rather expensive) Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 connector for Rs 4,500 (which I paid for with my Amazon Card cashback). There are no third-party options. Made more sense (given my needs) than spending Rs 6,000+ on a flimsy USB-C hub or Rs 12,000 on a USB-C dock like the Dell D6000. Thunderbolt docks in India are overpriced and unnecessary if you don't need the speed."

I approached online Apple service center, after initial diagnosis, they told to visit the the center in person.Is it designed in such way that the issue has to occur after the warranty period?"

senthil kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mac book air M1 review post 2 weeks of usage,"Well this is my first mac book!It's been more than 2 weeks! So far I have no complaints. Laptop boots up within 10 secs, battery life lasts more than 3 days. I have been doing basic stuff like browsing, connecting my ssd to transfers and watching movies to videos. I am not sure if its worth the money though as its pretty expensive for the basic model which is 86900 inr. As we know already its a fan less model, it literally has zero noise, it's gets very little warm on the surface after and hour or two of usage. Will give an complete review post 2 months."
Swati Sood,1.0 out of 5 stars,DEFECTIVE ITEM DELIVERED. STOPPED WORKING bs IN 2 HRS.,DEFECTIVE ITEM DELIVERED. STOPPED WORKING IN 2 HRS. Went to APPLE service center to get it checked. They told a defective item has been sold to you with hardware damage. When contacted seller and AMAZON for support Amazon refused to replace despite their being a 7 day replacement guarantee and all valid documents provided by Apple service center stating defective item. NEVER BUY ELECTRONICS FROM AMAZON. Go to a physical store. It might be expensive but won‚Äôt be defective. Amazon won‚Äôt help you at all after it has sold the product. They won‚Äôt even take your calls. Saying from personal experience.

Rahul,3.0 out of 5 stars,Turns out 8 GB ram isn't good enough for heavy programming,I got 512gb/8gb macbook air for mostly programming and development related tasks. But it's not good enough to handle multiple applications. I run chrome and intellij simultaneously and it hangs too much. The worst thing is you can't even upgrade your ram. Frustrated.

Moinak C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop in the market today!,The M1 based MacBook Air is simply the best laptop you can buy right now. With the MacBook Pro also using the M1 it's the first time in years that the Air's specs are almost identical to the Pro's at a much lower price point. For those worried most common applications like Chrome are already available native for M1. Other non native apps also work flawlessly.Pros:1. Noiseless2. High screen clarity3. Battery life of 3-5 days on average use4. Very light5. Fingerprint sensor6. Keyboard is so nice you feel like typing moreCons:1. Not a big fan of true tone but you can always turn it off

shashi,1.0 out of 5 stars,System is dead within 2 days.,The media could not be loaded. ¬†This is the first time i encounter such problem in apple products as i am a big fan of apple products usually they are known for their product long life but macbook air with m1 chip is a big disaster. It is dead within 3 days.Amazon please do something! After spending such fat money i can't bear any tension running behind service center. And the apple service center in patna.. omg they lost the ability to hear from their customers long back. And once you contact apple then they will tell you that apple is not responsible for the products sold by any third party website. The max they can do is to repair the system i mean really man? You buy new system and then give it to the service center for 3-4 weeks.

Nomadic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Buy Apple Products from Amazon,"Ordered the M1 Air on 5th August and got it delivered on the 7th. Then on 18th noticed a black/grey spot on the display... quick google search revealed this as a dead pixel and quite common with M1 Macs. So I called up Apple and they offered me two options, either a new replacement Mac or full refund since mine is still under 14 days. As soon as I revealed that I purchased from Amazon, the Apple sales team said sorry they can't help me since Amazon is not Apple authorised seller.I'm never buying another Apple product from Amazon again. If you want the full Apple experience like seamless replacement, refund or after sales then you need to buy it from Apple or from any of its authorised sellers. I made a costly mistake hope others will not after reading this message."

The best place to buy genuine and new apple products is at Apple India website."

RK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Giving shocks while charging,"Since the Macbook adapter is having only 2 pins, I am facing earthing issues and the laptop is giving shocks while charging. This is a very expensive laptop and Apple must provide a free 3 pin adapter to avoid earthing issues."

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Average Product,Got it for 63.6K after exchange of a Dell I3 laptop and ICICI card offer. At that price it is a decent machine but no point in buying it for 90K.

Now you may get the machine cheaper on Apple Official Website with better service delivery.

No way of fixing it. Also the ssd in integrated into the logic board so all of the data would also be lost.After spending almost a lac to buy the product and in just about a years time if the logic board stops working with no fault of the user, you cannot expect the customer to bear the cost for inadequate product & testing.

I'm using this machine since last 6 months, and it is working great (I've purchased from Apple Store, and got 18% GST benefits + 3000 Free accessories + 6000 HDFC CC discount). It was a great deal for me.Cons for me:- Camera is just 720p, and it sucks after paying a good amount for this machine.- It has 13inch screen, so you need an additional pay for monitor.- Expensive accessories like Mouse, keyboard, USB Hub etc.. We need around 50,000 more to buy these."

Vinod,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best standalone laptop.,"Top notch. 2 day battery life for medium use. Performance is great. So good that it stays cool to the touch even after an hour of continual use. Apple quality: the CNC Aluminum body is just perfection, with no sharp edges. The palm rest is rigid, supportive, and out of range of the hot components, meaning, it‚Äôs cool to the touch. Always. Now, the reason only 4 stars awarded to this amazing machine. The absolute garbage external monitor experience. Trust me. It‚Äôs bad. Though the output resolution is the promised 4K at 60hz, the font is rubbish, and the apps and windows are badly pixelated.Verdict: The best laptop to buy in 2020-21, if you aren‚Äôt planning on connecting it to an external display.If you liked this content, check out braintrooper.info"

V_111,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with its performance,"Go for this MacBook Air without a thought! I saw SO many reviews last year before buying this. There were such weird complaints that this heats up etc. and that is not true! I was deciding between this and MacBook Pro but bought this as only this was available during lockdown. Great decision and as I don‚Äôt need more advanced features. If you are not a gamer or video editor, then this should be the laptop of choice for you. I shifted from a Dell to this so adjusting to Mac OS took some time but I love it now and yeah my only issue is it‚Äôs too thin for my comfort. I have put a hard case on both sides to protect it and make it heavier. The speed, graphics, space all are top notch and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy a higher model. Five stars!"

NAVANITA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Go on get it , no regrets I promise","Okay so a few months ago I purchased the m1 macbook air base model and I can't believe how fast it is, when I compared it to the previous intel based macs this guy is leaps and bounds better than the Intel, if u have an Intel machine , it wouldn't even be possible for u to edit photos but m1 in this mac handles even the most heavy graphically intensive edits and games and more , if ur in a market for the best value for money and the best performance this is the laptop to get.And when it comes to the display, it comes with a little more than quad HD 2560√ó1600 resolution which comes with p3 color gamut for u display needs out there. The battery life u need not worry about its amazing , I get like 16 17 hrs of use on light use."
Harsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine,"Got this mac air @ ‚Çπ 83,700Its just amazing. I was using windows laptop earlier and decided to switch to mac and after using for 2 weeks i can say its great ..Each and every part of this laptop is just amazing, its display, its speaker, its keyboard, its trackpad, and ofcourse its build quality.... Every part is amazing."
pratham dubey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insanely powerful machine!!!,"I bought this product about a week ago and I'm obsessed. This is insanely powerful. And I love the color, I bought it in silver and it's so beautiful. I bought it through Apple official website and used Education discount in which I got MacBook Air M1, Silver, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM for ‚Çπ83610.Loving this MacBook. The design and the keyboard is the best. Feels good to write on keyboard. It's been 2 weeks and I haven't charged it yet. The battery life is good. And the best part it is so thin and compatible I love apple's design. The size is the only con but otherwise it's a win win. Best for students."
kanaklast Ambasta,4.0 out of 5 stars,If‡•§ a college student buy from apple store of education,"It's the best laptop for students as well as adults.I would recommend if you are a university student buy the macbook from apple store for education(online) where you will get this at a price of 83,000 only,that's almost 9to 10000 off!"
Shashwat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced,8gb of ram and 256gb of storage is too less for the price and performance is also okish. the operating system has useless animations everywhere and lacks basic functionality of connecting and transferring files(full access) from iphone and android(you cannot). usb-A port is Unavailable. Adapter is also not bundled.the macOS updates are buggy to the point it becomes unusable with random restarts. heating issues as well.the keyboard is simply trash.this is my first and last macbook purchase.the m1 chip inside is of no use unless you do video editing on final cut pro which you should buy separately.I would suggest to go with a windows laptop which will last you much longer if u have technical know how to get stuff done. you will get full control over your machine and you can install linux operating system after a few years as well.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty OS,The laptop was working fine till Apple release new OS on 26 jan 2022. After that they seem to have reduced the battery life of previous version using laptops by as much as 70%. this is horrible

I'm a music teacher, and my school was not listed in their database, so I contact Apple and they just set up the discount offer manually for me, and I got it for a sweet 83k! That's a huge 9k+ discount!Kind of makes sense if you're a parent or if you know someone who's a student / teacher / staff in any school, college or university."

The machine was running fine except few minor issues, until two days before when it suddenly died. Authorised apple repair store diagnosed it with motherboard damage, can't imagine what caused this. no dock connected at that time, never run on overload. Bought with my one year of saving, never thought of buying apple care as there was hardly any chance for accidental damage. My 4 years old dell bought for 27k, is now my saviour."

The M1 chip made it more powerful than ever. I was using macbook air 2017 earlier. I changed it in and don‚Äôt regret.
Lokendra singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best laptop at affordable price,
Pankaj K,4.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable high quality laptop (Long term review),"Pros:- If you‚Äôre switching from an older laptop like I did, the speed of the laptop is going to blow you away. Apple has really broken ground with their processors- Thin and light form factor- QHD screen / Retina Display- The battery life is really good. That‚Äôs again thanks to the power efficiency of the M1. I could easily get an entire work day without a charger- Aluminium unibody- Magic keyboard and best in class trackpad- USB C charging point Cons:- Lack of ports and variety does hinder usage. I‚Äôm using it with a dock to connect to a monitor, keyboard and mouse- full charge takes time. This is a bummer in the age of fast charging products- can notice the slowdowns when there are too many browser tabs open. Killing some apps resolves this tho- the thin body is a double edged sword. It can flex when under pressure like in a bag. I had to diagonally apply pressure to straighten it.- while the USB C charging point is a boon, the magnetic charging port from older models is missed- 60Hz screen- Subpar cameraI upgraded from a 2013 MacBook Pro to this and I‚Äôm not disappointed but yes, there is room for improvement. I cannot do away with MacBooks because of the connected ecosystem and my work flow. Despite the demerits - can score this 4/5."
Dorothy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best buy,Apple is always High value for money - its worth the buy and original product with perfect package. It was a gift and I loved the way it was delivered
Sourabh Garg,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's a great laptop with zero repairability,"The M1 processor is one of the fastest processor you can get. But if something goes wrong with this laptop after the warranty is over, you will need to buy a new one. Apple service centre will charge you around 70% of the value of the laptop for any small problem. They never repair the laptop, they only give you the option to replace the logic board for most of the problems. At that point, it will not make sense to pay this hefty amount, So will be forced to buy a new one."

Finally it is repaired now since under warranty, but could have costed me 50 grands to get it repaired when out of warranty. Worst product ever. Never going to buy an APPLE product ever in my life. Never ever. I have used several laptops, but being dead in just 2 months is a new thing. A piece of advice, don't buy it, there are plenty of other good products in the market which will last long, at the least longer than 6 months. Didn't expect it from a brand like Apple."

And then suddenly one day after 3 years of usage, screen flickered for about 30 secs in one go and this macbook won't start up again. I tried every method.I never put any external physical pressure on screen and handled it very gently. Screen flickering just after one year of usage is not expected from apple.Also usb ports stopped working after an year.Apart from screen flickering, usb ports, it didnot give me any other problem. Its light weight with battery charges up quickly."

If any such fault comes up in the new macbook air that you buy, you will get really stuck & your money might get wasted. Add to this the frustration & wasted time."
Himanshu Grover,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hinge problem exists.,I've bought the new MacBook Air M1 about 20 days ago and I have noticed a creaking noise every time I shut the lid down after having it open for a good amount of time. This noise isn't there when I open it and close it immediately though. It only happens when I close the lid after a while. I don't know if this is normal or if I should take it to a service person. I'm also wondering if it would be covered under warranty if there was any problem with the hinge. (It's a new laptop and I have not dropped it or damaged it in any way).
Nitin,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best and the beast for a reason,"This machine is incredible value for money. I got it for 61k Rupees (roughly 600$ for non indians) on diwali sale including no cost emi discount of 10k. At this price point, its an absolute beast and a satisfying buy.Pros:Screen- The screen quality is superb. You would always want to stick to such screen. Content looks super punchy to look at. One of the best screen you will ever see.Performance - Simply put, M1 is a monster. It will perform every task smoothly whatever you throw at it. You are never gonna face any lag in day to day activities. There is a clear difference between apple and intel chips. It never heats up even without an inbuilt fan.Battery - OMG ! What a stunner battery this has. Never imagined laptop battery could last for 15-16 hours on a single charge. Moreover, it hardly sucks any battery on standby mode. Totally impressive.Physical appearance - Incredible. Its lighter than 90 percent of laptops out there. And so slim as well. Physical appearance of this laptop is like cherry over cake. It feels so good just to hold this beauty and work on it.Speakers - Wow ! Never thought speaker on a laptop can be this good. I am a big music fan and this machine lets me stop using my headphones.Cons: Pricey ! For storage of 256gb its costly. Its a very good deal if you get it for 60-65k INR just like i did.Also, gold color is so underrated. It looks so lovely."

Kirandeep Sodhi,2.0 out of 5 stars,MacBook ? No please  ! NEVER  ever again !,"After having been an avid windows user through HP/dell laptops , I too got bitten by the bug of owning an apple product . So went and bought an apple MacBook Air with MI chip in sep 21 . First impressions were : wow , such a beautiful piece , great display , great sound quality etc etc . Needed adjustment to working with a mac after being with windows throughout but saw that as a thing I would eventually overcome . Fast forward 4 months of usage and despite the extreme delicate handling of the laptop , one fine day without any cause , suddenly the display went off and I started seeing a blank screen . Spoke to apple customer care , was directed to got to the local service centre , went there only to be told that warranty doesn‚Äôt hold in this case as the display would fall under accidental damage . Accident ???But when did that happen ? It neither fell down , neither did I keep anything heavy on it nor did I close it , nor was it being charged at that time !!!! . tried telling this to the service centre , then called up the customer care , shared the pics of the display and asked the same thing again , how can they call it an accident when no accident has happened , Got the best reply ever : Only you know or God knows how it happened . Wow , what a wonderful reply ! Apple is out of it . It‚Äôs between you and the grand master now . So what do I do now ? Get the display repaired at a cost of Rs 32,000 . Wait ! what ? 32 k ?So guys , I have had a very bad experience with the product as well as with the service centre and customer care . I am wary of getting the display repaired since I don‚Äôt know what caused the damage in the first place so what is the guarantee that the repaired screen will not suffer the same damage again .Now I am back to searching for a new HP / dell /Lenovo laptop for myself . Missing the sturdiness , economical maintenance ( a new display in this would cost abt 5k) and the windows interface . Bye Bye MacBook. And thanks to Apple for the worst support and care for their customers ."

Mayank Tiwari,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything you need at this price!,"I got this to replace my 7 years old Windows laptop and the difference is massive. This thing sprints past anything you throw at it. I primarily use it for my office work added to the Photoshop and Premier Pro edits in bits and pieces. It is unbelievably capable and efficient for a laptop that does not even have a fan to stop it from thermal throttling. I am listing down some of the pros and cons that I had found on using it for my daily tasks.Pros:1. Superfast M1 Chip. Nothing in the market at this price compares to what it does.2. Display: It is gorgeous. Windows laptops at this price give you a 1080p at max and this is 2560x1600. True Tone adds fire to it.3. Apple ecosystem: If you have an iPad or an iPhone, using devices together is effortless.4. Battery Life: It is insane. I am getting 12+ hours of SOT regularly with mixed usage. Having to charge a laptop once in 2 days increases its practicality exponentially.5. Design: It is flawless, sleek and lightweight.6. Trackpad: You dont see people talking about this part of MacBooks quite often but I think we should. It is amazing, the taptic feedback, the precision and the gestures are so good that you will never feel like going back to a physical mouse.Cons:1. Ports: The biggest issue for me is the lack of ports on this MacBook having only 2 USB-C and a 3.5mm audio jack, you sure need to buy an adapter right away to use almost everything with it.2. Camera: The 720p camera in 2021 sucks. It is not acceptable even with the optimisations Apple brought in with Big Sur.3. The price: The base model is only 256 GB and additional RAM or SSD costs a fortune.At last, I think if your usage is medium to heavy load on a regular basis, you should rather go for the Pro which has a fan to reduce the chances of thermal throttling causing a drop in performance. For everyone else, this laptop is more than you need."
anish,5.0 out of 5 stars,MacBook Air - This is my first MAC laptop.,"Alright, I have been a long time Windows User, and I must say that this laptop has been quite amazing. I mostly use this for minor video editing, using my cloud apps, working on my projects, coding and development, and for watching videos and browsing constantly. I had slightly dipped my toe in the Apple ecosystem back in 2020 when I had purchased an Ipad, which became my main computer for web browsing and reading books device. It also made me not use my main Windows computer even less as pretty much 60 percent of my workflow was transferred to my iPad. Now this MacBook has become my main device for basically every computing task I can think of. The typing experience has been stellar, quite simply the best keyboard on a laptop hands down! Also the built quality and the hinge design of this laptop made me feel safe to use this as frequently as I want and for as long as I want.My experience with Windows was on a sharp decline from being quite usable to getting in the way of my productivity. The amount of maintenance that my Windows PC requires was mind boggling, especially towards the end of its life cycle. This laptop was preceded by a computer with an FX 6300 chip and 8 gigs of RAM. So naturally, this was just a massive improvement. This laptop has scored 3 times the score of my previous computer on GeekBench. I can feel that difference in general usability and I personally feel that by daily drivering this laptop I have become a part of a revolution in the computing space. The apps in this mac have never taken more than 5 seconds to boot. Doesnt matter if the app is x86 or an ARM based app, all of them are super optimised. Also almost every general app has a 64 bit version out now so you can have that app in your system regardless. Now I realise that most people who will be buying this laptop are going to be either artists or developers, but even if you are a general user who wants a decent computer to learn stuff on or to use it for spreadsheet or document work, then this laptop is value for money, provided you have the budget for it. However, you do pay the Apple Tax with this product much like you do with every other product that the company has released in the country. If you can get it from US or UK, it is worth getting from there as you will obviously save copious amounts of money and you can also redeem the 1 year of international warranty should the need arise."
susheel chandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most affordable laptop in the category,"Although my purchase doesn't show it as verified, I have bought the MacBook Air on Amazon.I have transitioned from windows to Apple MacBook knowing that it's the first time that an apple device is actually value for money . This MacBook simply put just feels like a high end mobile phone. It's so smooth, buttery animations, excellent trackpad, excellent battery life and performance.Things that impressed me instantly:1. Display2. Speakers3. Trackpad4. Build Quality (Dense and strong)5. Battery life6. Performance7. Safari8. Wifi 6Yes, I was confused for a day but got used to whole macos and as a windows user once you get used to the macOS, you will start appreciating the laptop even more. OS wise, I would still like windows for office work. Air would be the best personal laptop where I am doing a lot of browsing and some coding for personal use. I dislike the folder structure and files part on Mac OS, so it's a no go for me for professional use unless I am forced to use it in the office.Issues:1. Absolutely nothingThis is not a specs game but what Apple is offering for 90k is much much more than the comparable laptops on the windows side. You cannot beat the build quality and smoothness on Mac.I am very impressed and hopefully the previous versions are nothing like this or else I would be disappointed that I didn't get this machine earlierUpdate after 1 month of usage:1.) Facing download issues in app store sometimes where the download speed is too slow. I think this is mac os 11.2.3 issue2.) Display is 2.7k and is crisp for a laptop. Speakers sound great. I have tried my headphones and BT earphones, both seem to have enhanced sound quality while using on a Mac. Maybe they have put a quality DAC.3.) Can't install windows through bootcamp, can do with parallels but parallels is expensive.4.) The default office apps are of no use (pages, numbers etc). I am currently using libre office but office 365 would be great. If you buy windows laptop of similar price, most probably you will get office suite for free5.) Some apps don't work well, they keep crashing (ex: Spotify, Twitter).6.) For basic use, I think nobody needs a macbook air, because there is good amount of downside if you are transitioning from windows. If you are into video editing or coding, I would highly recommend this product.7.) iPhone and iPad apps suck. Don't even need to download.8.) You can't play games because of Apple's decision . Apple arcade and apple tv+ have disappointing games and tv shows. Not worth paying a pennyVerdict: I feel the app transition from intel based to arm architecture is still incomplete and has a lot of scope for improvement. If these base laptops are going to be the cheapest in the line till next year, I would recommend you to buy else look for later editions which are rumoured to come with mini led display and more ports with more processing power."
Shiran Lone,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super excited,"If we could get it for around 70-75k with some kind of discount that would b huge.. anyways, super excited."
Prad,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST!,"Best in class. Performance, Display, Battery backup are above excellent.A must have for every tech geekBought this after selling my Yamaha R15, but no regrets.... It's speed is better than R15. üòÖ"
Kamala gude,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!!,"The hardest part about buying a macbook air or any apple product for that matter is not worrying about the price, but choosing the colour.Initially, looking at the photos, I thought gold would look nice and unique but when I went to the store and checked it, it seemed to be very cheap and tacky. However, at the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference.Anyway, this left me with two options, namely, silver and space grey.Silver seemed a little too plain and boring and it kinda looked like all the other models and was a bit over-contrasting. So I ended up picking space grey. Although people online mentioned it to be dull, when I went and checked it out in the store, it looked super classy.Before ordering on Amazon, I'd highly recommend you to first go to the store and check the colours out. Don't rely on the photos online.Also, don't be apprehensive about purchasing on Amazon cause u will get a genuine product. Make sure to check your serial number on the Apple website. Plus, to avoid scratches, refrain from using laptop bags with zips and avoid wearing watches or jewellery while using it.This is by far the best laptop I've ever come across. It's worth spending those extra 15-20k. Don't even think while choosing macbook vs windows. No windows laptop could ever come close to macbook air.Also, refrain from buying the latest macbook pros worth 1.5l+. They're so not worth the amount you're paying. Most features are exactly the same as air and there's no major difference except for the touch bar which is crap in my opinion."
Manav S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money purchase,"This is one of the best laptop I have used in the recent times. Whatever other positive reviews have stated is totally correct. Best thing about this laptop is that it stays cool no matter what you do. It has the best battery backup out there. I am getting around 14-15 hours on a single charge. The display is top notch with great viewing angles and good brightness levels. The output from speakers is a melody to your ears. I won't say a word about the chip. I think even after m1 pro is released, this would be the one that will sell in numbers because former would cost around 2 lakh in India. Most of the softwares are now available for Aarch64. I am a developer and still haven't installed Rosetta 2. Recommend to use Safari as your daily browser as it saves a lot of battery life and it's blazing fast. Will add a 3 month review after some time."

syed nadeem,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dont look beyond this,"There is nothing that I could have asked more from this machine and from the seller ‚ÄúAmazon‚ÄùI m a programmer and have always relied on beefy systems for my usage. I was a little apprehensive about the machine but went a head as there was a huge discount on the prime day sale on the 16 gig model.So far Im mighty impressed with this machine and to give you a context, I have been using 2019 model MacBook pro 32/1 Tb version for my office. I cant make out any difference in performance between the two and to be honest this one is a silent and compact machine that I prefer over the MacBook pro.A special mention to the battery. I have never seen a laptop give moe then 5 hours of backup while the cpu usage of more then 55%.This is one product which is the most value for money from Apple. Period"

ARUNAVA GHOSH,1.0 out of 5 stars,AVOID AMAZON FOR APPLE PRODUCTS,"Strongly recommend DO NOT BUY any apple products either airpods, ipads, mac, iphone or even apple pencil or charger from Amazon! Because even after the ""7 days replacement"" note on the seller or the product page, Amazon not gonna provide you a straight simple easy-going replacement at your door step.No matter what ever product you've received, duplicate or broken or even a empty box....They gonna straight send you to the service centre & after that service centre will guide you further! Amazon call it ""apple products policy"" they never mention! & You have to visit the service centre & collect documentation & whatever needed in between the replacement policy days!Remember service centre always tries to repair the product.& Even after that you not gonna have a straight easy refund!!When you finally have to visit the service centre for a return policy even if you get a duplicate or defective product, which not gonna happen from your home, then why to buy it from online & not from a retail store!?"

Shiva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Experience with Mac is excellent BUT !!!,"- The transition from windows to Mac will take time like keyboard shortcuts, track pad shortcuts, e.t.c and we have to be patient- Microsoft office has to be brought separately in case of collaborating with other window OS user. For others, Pages, Numbers and Keynote is very good.- We have to check softwares in https://isapplesiliconready.com and check whether it is available. Because some of them are not supported by native m1 EVEN NOW.- In collaboration, Microsoft Teams is still not support by native m1 which is not at all good.- For backend development: NetBeans and Eclipse is still not supported with native m1. But we can use Visual Studio Code with required plugin till the support is available.- Using softwares with rosetta 2 have some significant battery drain when compared with native m1 softwares. Though it will not noticeable for normal usersOther than that Mac is :Very light weightBattery is excellentNo performance issues so far for development activities"

Not all have been migrated to the arm architecture.3) Only two usbc ports. You HAVE to buy a dongle worth a good 4-6k along with it."

Surinder Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"MacBook pro with m1 pro is a gigantic upgrade from the intel macs. Although expensive, its worth the price if you can afford to buy one. I am most impressed with the mini led display. Here are some pros and cons I found:-Pro‚Äôs1. The display. You get the better xdr display on this machine than the pro display xdr.2. M1 pro has the perfect balance of battery and power. M1 max has higher gpu performance but takes a chunk of your battery as well. Ymmv.3. Speakers. It‚Äôs loud, clear and has a ton of low end. Thoroughly impressed.4. It‚Äôs a quiet machine and doesn‚Äôt get hot.5. Lack of touchbar.6. It looks much more sleek in person.Con‚Äôs1. Magsafe is too tight. It takes your machine with you if you pull the cable at a straight angle.2. Camera smoothes your face too much. Looks average.3. Notch is an eyesore but you get used to it.4. Safari doesn‚Äôt support 120hz for some reason. Apps in general needs updating for 120hz.5. Hdmi 2.0 instead of 2.1, 4k 120hz not possible from hdmi port.Overall, it‚Äôs almost a perfect laptop if you know how to utilise its potential.Great job apple."
Sanchit Khandelwal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent All Round Laptop,"I was really torn between MBA and Asus Zephyrus G14 in the festival sale; both were coming at a great price and are really good at what they do. I was a little biased towards G14 initially due to familiarity of windows and since it can game as well. But finally, after much deliberation I went with MBA, since it does all the basics so well and got it an excellent price of 71k in the sale!And boy, oh boy! What a good decision that has been. The battery life, high resolution screen, speakers and overall build quality are all excellent. I regularly get more than 12 hrs of battery life in my daily use, the machine is always on and wakes up in less than a second. It also never got hot with my daily use, even without a fan. The Mac OS did take some time to get used to it but is overall a very polished OS. I would recommend any prospective buyer to watch a few YouTube videos to familiarize them with it to ease the transition.Overall its a great laptop and you can't go wrong with it, unless you are working on some specific software which doesn't have a Mac OS substitute or unless you like to game on your primary machine."

Karandeep Malik,5.0 out of 5 stars,A performance packed machine,"This is my second macbook air and like my previous macbook air 2017 this one made me go ga ga as well. I am very impressed with the battery back up and processing power of this machine. I had to buy a connector for various ports which is a pain as this version has only 3 ports. 2 USB-C on one side and a 3.5 mm audio jack on the other side. The display is awesome and clear. This version is a little heavier than 2017 Macbook air though. 256 GB sdd space was enough for me as I have external sdd and hdd where I store most of my data. The charger is different from the earlier Macbook Air 2017. Firstly there is no separate extension cable as was with 2017 Air. The charger is a USB -C charger and after connecting the charger only one USB -C port remains free for use which makes a connector must. The connector that I purchased had 2 male USB C ports on one side to connect and 2 USB - C female, 2 USB - A female, MMC Card female and HDMI female port on other ends. The Air comes with MacOS Big Sur pre installed."

Ahmad Naik,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best value for money Macbook in years.,"The M1 obliterates other laptops in price to value comparisons. While it is not necessarily the powerhouse some might claim - it breezes through almost all regular daily use scenarios. It‚Äôs well built - has a keyboard that‚Äôs miles better than the ones in the past few years, a decent screen - and is possibly one of the easiest macs to recommend. If this fits your budget - and you‚Äôre not a heavy gamer or professional video editor or something along those lines - go for this blindly. It‚Äôs that good."

Performance is silky smooth and the charging is super fast. Expect a battery back up of 15-20 hours.Routine tasks like file transfer, copy paste etc seem cumbersome at the first instance and need some getting used to. So is syncing your data with your iPhone. I found it a little cumbersome compared to the simple data transfer between a windows pc and an android phone.Two ports are too less and hence you would need accessories to have usb ports/hdmi port/card reader etc.Overall a wonderful experience and worth every penny."

Hanmant,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but it‚Äôs actually great value for money,"So if you are comfortable with the dongle situation and if the softwares you use can run on MacOS, this is the machine to go for. It has a 2K Display and mind blowing battery life. It‚Äôs a really good machine to work on. Especially coming from a 2.5kg Gaming Laptop this was a welcome change, you can actually use this like a LAP-top. The lack of fans means you can use it on virtually any surface.Points to note:It has just 2 Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack, so you need to use Accesories with Bluetooth compatibility or a dongle.If you are getting the base model like me, get a secondary storage device. You‚Äôll blow through the 256 Gigs even before you know it."

kiwi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best product Apple's made, considering everything","A value for money product from Apple? Sounds ridiculous, I know. But it truly is. The M in M1 probably stands for 'monster'. Incredible performance! This entry-level beast beats most of the top-end Intel laptops without breaking a sweat.The display is gorgeous af. Yeah the bezels could've been slimmer considering it's a late 2020 model but not that much of a big deal.The build is fantastic. The keyboard is wonderful. Speakers sound exceptional albeit not too loud. Mac OS is years ahead of Windows. The M1 chip has truly taken MacBooks to a different league where there are no other players. It's all Apple! Remarkable. The M1 Pro and M1 Max aren't even needed if you aren't into insanely graphics-intensive work."

Amberish Raj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super product and blazing fast delivery,"Great product by Apple. This replaced my 4 year old Macbook Air, which is still working great, its just storage felt a bit short.Being a Frontend Engineering this is more than enough for me, even it open scope for me to do some heavy duty things as well, and I guess it will handle that perfectly too.Impressed by Amazon's same day delivery. Happy to receive it same day."

Rithwik,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,"A premium device for your premium needs. For people coming from Windows background, once you get used to mac, then there‚Äôll be no turning back since the stark difference in speed, performance and experience won‚Äôt let you. Timeless design; Futureproof performance; Epic battery life. Apple‚Äôs new M1 venture is off to a good start and intel should definitely take a note or two (it‚Äôs finally time to move to the ARM architecture processors from the x86 architecture ones. If Apple can pull this out, Intel surely can)"

SRGINC,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Masterpiece !,"Have been a windows user from 15+ Years, first time with the mac took a time getting used to but everything is on point with this laptop. Both software and hardware are seamlessly designed where everything is on point and has useful functionality. The M1 processor and the battery life it offers is simply mind blowing .I paired it with a Dell USB C monitor with an inbuilt hub for ease of use.Although configuring things like native windows software/ Printer is a pain point but overall a positive experience once you get used to it.Another pain point is all the accessories are 3x pricier compared to the windows eco system, A basic Mac compatible wireless keyboard mouse set is starting from 5k and this carries down to all other accessories as well."
Keerthan K Acharya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply the best,"The best laptop for all your needs. Superb battery, display is fantastic, thin and light worth the money i feel"
arpit arora,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.5/5,"Batter life is amazing, blends right into the apple universe, front camera is okay, the drawback is Microsoft office - shortcuts don‚Äôt work and using a mouse for operation excel is tedious."

Harsh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute beast!!!,"Amazon sometimes miss to mention device serial number on warranty slip & invoice plz make to raise the ticket to get it updated else warranty claims is hell difficult, device serial number on invoice is mandatory as per apple service policy, for me they took almost 15 days to update, if you face such problem customer is eligible to get replacement if not unboxed! It‚Äôs far better to get other delivery in next day rather waiting 15 days for invoice update !! ( important )M1 device is absolute beast no where intel chips are comparable to apple silicon. Battery backup is extremely good 12-13hrs in average or more depending on usage , performance 10/10, keyboard is 10/10,Screen 8/10 has Bassels could have been improved betters is new MacBook Pro 16‚Äù, over all worth for money 9/10,This MacBook Air has no word of heating issues in its dictionary it‚Äôs so cool and silent even in peak load.Note : if you care about your money plz buy at offline store if something goes wrong in delivery mismatch in serial number etc then consider your money is not yours for ever.
